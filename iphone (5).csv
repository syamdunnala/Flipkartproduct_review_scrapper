iphone,Sravan Kumar Chokkavarapu,5,Great product,Who all loves older size i.e.: 4.7 inch type should definitely go for this.  Nothing is better than XR: XS or 11. Best for price and usage.
iphone,Flipkart Customer,4,Worth the money,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it’s worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating
iphone,Saurabh N,4,Nice product,Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years: with a decent camera: waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...
iphone,ankit paliwal,5,Best in the market!,One word.. beautiful iphone ❤️ premium feelJust go for it without any doubt. Superb camera: handy: white color is soo good. This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones.
iphone,Prashant Kumar Sharma,1,Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins. Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins. Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I’m using. I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn’t look nice to me.
iphone,Apurba Pan,5,Perfect product!,The powerful small phone that I always wished for !!Nowadays the fad is big screen phones but for me: I like a small powerful phone with awesome camera. Ticked all the boxes that I had in my mind. Switched from android. Never going back!

iphone,Vishnu Av,5,Best in the market!,As being a frequent apple user: I couldn't find much of a difference when comparing to IPhone 6.The size and display are the same of IPhone 6 and ofcourse there is 0 negative comments for the A13 chip. It is super fast✌️.Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.No negative comments for the camera: apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights: a front facing portrait camera: a wider photo fr...

iphone,Neha Singh,5,Just wow!,I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand. I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and it’s just great. I am a big fan of iOS and I’m deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad: MacBook: AirPods and an old iPod and I’m not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically ...
